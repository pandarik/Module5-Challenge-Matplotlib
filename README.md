# Module5-Challenge-Matlotlob - Pymaceuticals Inc. SCC Treatment Analysis with Matplotlib

## Overview
Welcome to the repository containing a detailed analysis of clinical trial data for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treatments. This project showcases the power of Matplotlib in visualizing data to tell a compelling story.

## Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company, is at the forefront of developing anti-cancer medications. The company's recent focus has been on screening potential treatments for SCC. As part of this initiative, a comprehensive animal study was conducted involving 249 mice to evaluate the efficacy of various drug regimens, including the company's flagship drug, Capomulin.

## Objective
The goal of this analysis is to generate insightful tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study, providing a top-level summary of the results and demonstrating the capabilities of Matplotlib in data visualization.

## Tasks
The analysis encompasses several key tasks:
- Data preparation and cleaning.
- Generation of summary statistics.
- Creation of bar and pie charts.
- Calculation of quartiles, identification of outliers, and box plot generation.
- Development of line and scatter plots.
- Computation of correlation and regression models.

## Files
- `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb `: The Jupyter Notebook with all the analysis and Matplotlib visualizations.
- `Mouse_metadata.csv and Study_results.csv`: The datasets used for the analysis.

## Instructions
To replicate this analysis:
1. Ensure Python and jupyter installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `pymaceuticals_starter.ipynbâ€™ in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Visualizations
The visualizations created include:
- Bar charts comparing the number of data points for each drug regimen.
- Pie charts showing the gender distribution of the mice.
- Box plots highlighting the final tumor volume distribution for key drug regimens.
- A line plot of tumor volume over time for a selected mouse treated with Capomulin.
- A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen, with a linear regression model overlaid.

## Summary Statistics
The summary statistics table includes the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

## Data Analysis
The analysis involved 249 mice with SCC tumors and examined the efficacy of various drug regimens over 45 days. The key metrics analyzed include tumor volume, mouse weight, and the correlation between them.

## Observations and Insights
- Capomulin shows promise in reducing tumor size, with lower average and median tumor volumes compared to other regimens.
- The consistency in Capomulin's results suggests reliability as a treatment option.
- A strong positive correlation exists between mouse weight and tumor volume, indicating that heavier mice tend to have larger tumors.

## Conclusion
The visualizations and statistics generated provide a clear and concise overview of the study's findings, emphasizing the effectiveness of Capomulin in treating SCC.
